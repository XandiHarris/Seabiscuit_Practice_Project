            <h3>Before Adoption</h3>
            <p>
                On September 16, 2015 a Chiweenie was born in the lonely streets of a small town in Kentucky. She was found by a woman working for a local rescue at two weeks old. The woman named the puppy Noel and cared deeply for her in the next two years. The woman also rescued many animals so Noel was never alone. After her spay the stress of her house became too much. The woman and her partner had decided to foster children in their house which became too much for the loving pup. Noel began snarling and snapping with no notice, she became overly anxious, and stopped eating her food. This home was once a sanctuary for Noel, but with the kids pulling at her legs and generally abusing her it was time for the woman to find her a new home. Early February of 2018 Noel was listed on a local adoption site. The woman was looking to move Noel into a single dog home, with no children. The woman introduced Noel to her potential adopter explaining everything the little dog had been through. She even told the potential adopter that she had been returned twice, and if Noel didn't fit in to her new home she could be brought back. That potential adopter was me, Alexandria Harris.

            <h3>The Adoption</h3>
            <p>
                On February 8th my mom and I went to the local dog stores, got everything I needed to bring a dog into my small onebedroom apartment.While there we got different toys and treats, a cute donut leash and collar, and most importantly a new dog tag. After many hours of research and polling I had decided that if I did adopt this dog I would rename her. So as I stood at the dog tag engraving machine a tear drips down my cheek as I type in Seabiscuit. This has been what I wanted to name my first dog since I was little. This moment was absolutley surreal. It was happening, I was going to meet my new dog the next day. My mom and I arrive in Georgetown, and waiting at the door was my new pup. I rushed inside and immediatly began playing with her. The woman explained so many things, but i couldn't hear any of them over the breathing of this sweet pup in my lap. From that moment on I knew I had the whole world in my hands, and I wasn't giving her up for anything. On February 9, 2018 I took Seabiscuit Harris to her new home in Louisville, KY!!!

            <h3>Changing Lives One Paw at a Time</h3>
            <h4>Seabiscuit</h4>
            <p>
                When I got her she was afraid of Men, children, other dogs, food, and having her back end touched. I ran out of the dog food her previous owner was feeding her. So when I went to the pet store I tried a new brand. She immediatly scarfed it down like ive never seen before. On day 2 i introduced her to Taylor, who would become her new dad. She wouldn't go near him. if he picked her up she would fight him to get away. A week later she was crying anytime he would leave the room. Since I got her I began socializing her. She no longer hides behind me when a small human comes to pet her. I do have to make sure they wait to pet her when she is looking at them. Anytime we see another dog she cries until we get close enough for her to say hello to them.

            <h4>Friends and family</h4>
            <p>In the first month of her coming into my life she quickly became the center of not only my world, but everyone around me. 
                Because of Seabiscuit, my mom was able to leave the banking world and start her own business. 
                Now she is happier than ever being her own boss! 
                At social getherings Seabiscuit has become the life of the party. She finds the nearest lap and gives everyone a little needed one on one attention.

            <h4>Me</h4>
            <p>
                Before Biscuit I was incomplete. I hadn't figured out my purpose/path yet. 
                Becoming soley responsible for another life has changed me.
